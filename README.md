# scripts for RIE 

This contains scripts I wrote for crawling the multilingual and rich information plenary sessions from Europarl website (http://www.europarl.europa.eu/).

I called this resulting corpus as RIE which represents for Rich Information Europarl. 

RIE was used in the following work:

	Incorporating Side Information into Recurrent Neural Network Language Models
	Cong Duy Vu Hoang, Reza Haffari and Trevor Cohn. 
	In  Proceedings of NAACL-16 (short), 2016.
